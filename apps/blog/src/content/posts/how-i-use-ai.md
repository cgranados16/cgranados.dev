This post was co-written by an AI.

Yep—you're reading words drafted by a machine, reviewed and shaped by me. I like that. It's honest, efficient, and a good example of how I see AI fitting into modern software workflows.

AI isn’t here to replace engineers. It’s here to amplify them. For me, that means treating it like a versatile tool in my stack—one I can use to speed up brainstorming, draft content or code, validate ideas quickly, and skip repetitive tasks I’ve solved a hundred times before.

When I write code or architect systems, especially in fast-moving environments with multiple tools, teams, or frameworks, speed matters. But so does quality. And AI helps bridge both. It's not magic, but it saves me cycles on things like markdown drafts, code snippets, migration guides, or even naming conventions.

This post? I told the assistant, "Write a short post in my voice about AI, mention that it was made by AI." That was it. I reviewed the output, tweaked the tone, and hit publish.

If you're not already using AI in your dev workflow, you're missing out. Not because it replaces your thinking—but because it gives you more space to do the deep thinking that matters.
