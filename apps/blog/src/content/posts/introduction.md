Outside of work, I love working out, have played guitar since I was 13, and am a huge fan of video games.

I also have a dog, a Golden Retriever named Ace. He just turned 3 years old in May 2024. Whether he's accompanying me on hikes or just lounging by my side while I code, Ace is an integral part of my daily routine.
